# Journal

What we did, and what surprised us. One entry per working session, newest
first. The surprises are the point — a journal of what went to plan is a
changelog with worse formatting.

## 2026-08-26 — The domain, before any screen

**Did.** Stood up the monorepo (pnpm workspaces, Turborepo, TypeScript strict
with `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` and `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`) and wrote
`packages/domain` end to end: the trip state machine, position cleaning, the
tracking policy, money, pricing and settlement, the ETA model, and the matching
engine. 136 tests, all green. ADRs 0001–0004. The purity boundary is a lint
rule and `scripts/boundary-check.sh` proves the rule still fires.

Engines before screens, deliberately, and further ahead of the roadmap than it
looks: the trip machine belongs to phase 2 and the matching engine to phase 5,
but both are pure arithmetic that can be written and tested now, without a
device, and having them settled makes the app layer thin.

### What surprised us

**The pricing model was wrong, and only a real route showed it.** Rates were
per tonne-kilometre — how freight is costed in most of the world, and not how
anybody in Nigerian haulage talks. The arithmetic was clean, the tests were
green, and it quoted **₦398,400 for a Lagos–Kano trailer run** that goes for
something over two million naira. Nothing in the code looked wrong. What caught
it was a test that asserted a range a haulier would recognise, against a real
830 km corridor, rather than a range the formula would produce. Rewritten to
price the truck against the road, with tonnage deciding only which truck.

**Bid ranking handed every load to the cheapest bidder.** Price was scored by
position within the spread of bids received. With two bids of ₦1,800,000 and
₦2,000,000, the dearer one scored *zero* on price — as though it were
infinitely expensive — because it happened to be the top of a two-bid range.
So a carrier with 2 on-time trips out of 6 beat one with 39 out of 40, which is
the exact failure the ranking exists to prevent. Now a proportional premium
over the cheapest bid, which keeps what the spread version was reaching for —
₦50,000 apart is a lot on a city run and nothing on a Kano haul — without
letting the sample size set the sensitivity.

**A dropped position fix used to take the rest of the leg with it.** The
cleaner rejected a cell-tower fix that snapped 800 km across the country, then
compared the *next* good fix against the bad one, decided that was an
implausible jump too, and kept going. One bad reading could eat an entire leg.
A rejected fix is no longer used as the baseline for the next.

**Banning the `Date` global was too blunt.** The rule that stops an engine
reading the clock also caught `new Date(now.getTime() + ms)` — which is
literally how you project an arrival. Narrowed to the two shapes that actually
read the clock: argless `new Date()` and `Date.now()`.

**A parked truck can drift into movement.** Two fixes of a stationary truck,
each accurate to ±90 m, can sit 180 m apart. Counted as travel, an overnight
stop invents kilometres onto a per-kilometre rate. Movement now has to clear
the combined uncertainty of both fixes before it counts as movement at all.

### Still open

- The ETA model here is the **fallback tier only**. The technical design calls
  for corridor segmentation with empirical transit-time distributions from
  Backhaul's own completed trips. There are no completed trips yet, so building
  that now would be a model fitted to nothing. Tracked in the backlog.
- The escalation of a stall to a shipper alert is defined but not wired to
  anything, because there is no notification layer yet.
- No screens. Nothing here has been looked at, and Grid's clearest lesson is
  that the worst defects are invisible to a green test suite and surface only
  from looking at rendered output.
